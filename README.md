# MolecularDynamics-cMet-VEGFR2
KinaseInhibitorDynamics features molecular dynamics simulations of Triametren, Cabozantinib, and Crizotinib interacting with c-Met and VEGFR2. Each 10 ns simulation is visualized in GIFs, highlighting key binding interactions for cancer therapy research. 

Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Kinase Inhibitors
This repository contains GIF animations showing the molecular dynamics simulations of three kinase inhibitors interacting with c-Met and VEGFR2 proteins:
1.Triametren
2.Cabozantinib
3.Crizotinib
**Simulation Details:-**
Each simulation was run for a total of 10 nanoseconds (ns)
The GIFs visualize the binding modes and conformational changes of the inhibitors within the active sites of c-Met and VEGFR2
Key protein-ligand interactions and structural rearrangements are highlighted
