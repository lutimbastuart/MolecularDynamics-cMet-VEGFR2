## Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Kinase Inhibitors

This repository contains GIF animations showing the molecular dynamics simulations of three kinase inhibitors interacting with c-Met and VEGFR2 proteins:

1. Triametren
2. Cabozantinib
3. Crizotinib

## Simulation Details

- Each simulation was run for a total of 10 nanoseconds (ns)
- The GIFs visualize the binding modes and conformational changes of the inhibitors within the active sites of c-Met and VEGFR2
- Key protein-ligand interactions and structural rearrangements are highlighted
